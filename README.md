# To-do-List-App
This to-do app is a simple yet useful application built using Python and Tkinter module. It provides a graphical user interface where users can easily add and delete tasks from a to-do list. The app stores the tasks in a file named "data.txt" for persistent data storage.

The GUI window contains a title, two labels, a list box, a text box for input, and two buttons for adding and deleting tasks. The user can enter a task in the text box and add it to the list by clicking the "Add" button. The added task is also saved to the "data.txt" file. The user can select a task from the list and delete it by clicking the "Delete" button, which also updates the "data.txt" file.
